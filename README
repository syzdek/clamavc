I. About
--------

Clam AntiVirus Client Library provides a simple API to the ClamAV daemon.
ClamAVC does not require ClamAV to be installed. ClamAVC communicates with
clamd using clamd's documented protocol using either TCP or a local Unix
domain socket.

 * Git >= 1.6.0
 * GNU Autoconf >= 2.61
 * GNU Automake >= 1.10
 * GNU Libtool >= 1.5.6
 * GNU Make >= 3.80

Downloading source code:

 $ git clone git://github.com/syzdek/clamavc.git

Preparing the source for compiling:

 $ cd clamavc
 $ libtoolize -c
 $ aclocal
 $ autoheader
 $ autoconf
 $ automake -c -a


III. TODO list
--------------

 * Test code against clamd with fake virus in order to verify correct
   error reporting by the library.
 * review and clean up the code.
 * Test library on OS X 10.5, FreeBSD 7.2, Slackware 12.1, and Solaris 9
